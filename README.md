# messsage_to_tf
ROS2 port for converting messages such as odom and pose to tf

Based on the [original ROS1 node](https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_localization/blob/catkin/message_to_tf/src/message_to_tf.cpp).
Currently this package only supports odometry messages. Contributions to support other
message types would be appreciated.
